# CASIS Satellite Tracker

In this Code Pattern, we will build a satellite tracker using  Node-RED and IBM Watson.
A flow will be created for connecting a Watson Assistant Chatbot with a node-red-contrib-satellites node, as well as a web UI and worldmap node.

When the reader has completed this Code Pattern, they will understand how to:

* Build a complex flow and web UI using simple Node-RED tools.
* Implement a chatbot with Watson Assistant and embed it on a web page with Node-RED.
* Get satellite information for the International Space Station (ISS) and use it in a web app.

## Flow

1. User interacts with Web UI to query the chat bot "Where is the ISS?".
2. Web UI communicates with Node-RED running on IBM Cloud.
3. Node-RED app running on the cloud processes info and performs HTTP requests.
4. The Node-RED app communicates with Watson Assistant to extract intents and entities.
5. Satellites orbiting the earth send position info which is streamed to Node-RED module.

## Included components

* [Watson Assistant](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/conversation.html): Create a chatbot with a program that conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods.

## Featured technologies

* [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/): Node-RED is a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting ways.
* [Artificial Intelligence](https://medium.com/ibm-data-science-experience): Artificial intelligence can be applied to disparate solution spaces to deliver disruptive technologies.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): An open-source JavaScript run-time environment for executing server-side JavaScript code.

### 1. Clone the repo

Clone the `casis-satellite-tracker` locally. In a terminal, run:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/IBM/casis-satellite-tracker
```

### 2. Create Watson services with IBM Cloud

Create the [*Watson Assistant*](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/conversation) service by providing a name of your choice and clicking `Create`.

Once created, you'll see either the credentials for *username* and *password* or an IAM *apikey*, either of which you should copy down to be used later. (Click `Show` to expose them).

### 3. Import the Watson Assistant workspace

Once you have created your instance of Watson Assistant, click `Launch Tool`, then click the `Workspaces` tab. Import the workspace by clicking the upload icon:

![](https://github.com/IBM/pattern-images/blob/master/watson-assistant/UploadWorkspaceJson.png)

Click `Choose a file` and navigate to [`data/workspaces/SatTrackWorkspace.json`](data/workspaces/SatTrackWorkspace.json) in this repo. Click `Import`.

Get the Workspace ID by clicking the 3 vertical dots on the `Workspaces` tab. Save this for later.

</p>

### 4. Get the Watson Assistant credentials

The credentials for IBM Cloud Watson Assistant service can be found
by selecting the ``Service Credentials`` option for the service. You
saved these in [step #2](#2-create-watson-services-with-ibm-cloud).

The `WORKSPACE_ID` for the Watson Assistant workspace was saved in
[step #3](#3-import-the-watson-assistant-workspace).

### 5. Create a Node-RED Workspace

From the the [IBM Cloud Catalog](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/) navigate to `Platform` -> `Boilerplates` and choose [Node-RED Starter](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/starters/node-red-starter). Choose a name and click `Create`.

Once the App has deployed, click on `Visit App URL`

![](https://github.com/IBM/pattern-images/blob/master/node-red/NodeRedVisitAppURL.png)

Follow the instructions to `Secure your Node-RED editor` and `Browse available IBM Cloud nodes`. Click `Finish` and then click `Go to your Node-RED flow editor`.

### 6. Get a LocationIQ API key

You will need an API key from [LocationIQ](https://locationiq.com/) for the reverse geocoding function in this app.

* Visit the [LocationIQ website](https://locationiq.com/) and scroll down to `Excited?! Get a developer token!`. Input your name and email and follow the instructions to get an API token. Save this for later, when you configure the `credentials` node.

### 7. Install additional nodes

You will need to install the following additional nodes:

* [node-red-contrib-credentials](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-credentials)
* [node-red-contrib-web-worldmap](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-web-worldmap)
* [node-red-contrib-satellites](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-satellites)

Click the menu icon in the upper right and then `Manage palette`.

![](https://github.com/IBM/pattern-images/blob/master/node-red/NodeREDmanagePallete.png)

Click the `Install tab` and enter the name of the node you wish to install into the search bar, then click `install`.

### 7.a Build the Node-RED flow manually

Follow these instructions to [Build the Node-RED flow manually](doc/CreateFlow.md).

### 7.b Import the completed Flow

We will walk through the steps to build the Node-RED flow, but you can import the completed Flow. Copy the flow to your machine's clipboard by navigating to `data/Node/`.

A flow can be moved to a Mac OS clipboard with:
```
$ pbcopy < ISS_flow.json
```

On Windows use:
```
$ cat ISS_flow.json | clip
```

On Linux use:
```
$ cat ISS_flow.json | xclip
```

Once the `ISS_flow.json` is on your clipboard, Click the upper-right menu icon and choose `Import` -> `Clipboard`. Paste the contents of your clipboard and click `Import`.
